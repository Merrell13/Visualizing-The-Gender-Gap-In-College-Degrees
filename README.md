Plotting data using Matplotlib.

A visualization of the gender gap in 17 different degree fields from 1970 to 2012.

The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

Below I will plot a line chart of each column using the various plot aesthetic techniques available on the Python modules Matplotlib and Pandas.
